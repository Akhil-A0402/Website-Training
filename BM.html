        <h3 style="color:navy">About Blue Micro</h3>
        <p>
            Blue Micro is meant for a site that doesn't necessarily need a huge amount of<br>
            content. I've found that trying to put small amount of text onto a large template<br>
            ends up in a site that looks slightly off. So this template is for those that need a<br>
            quick and simple site<br>
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:navy">Titles are H1 Tags</h3>
        <p>
            Try to include your keywords in the titles since they are what search engines pick up,<br>
            it's also a good idea to try to include those same keywords in the title as well (only<br>
            one of two of your best ones).<br>
            
        </p>
        <h3 style="color:navy">Background Image</h3>
        <p>
            I debated using a fancy background for this template, but ultimately just decided to<br>
            keep it blank. I did however create all the images with Alpha transparency , which<br>
            means that regardless of what background you choose =, it will always look good. So<br>
            keep it white, or experiment with it if you please.<br>

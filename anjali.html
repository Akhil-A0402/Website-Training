      The main image can be changed by either replacing the current image with another one of the same size (900x402), or using a new one of what ever dimensions you'd like. if you choose the latter, you must open up style css and change the dimensions of #mainpic, as well as the file name if that is different. if you would like to move the heading around in the above image. find "#mainpic h1" in style css and modify it's "left" and "top" properties, this is also true for the h2 tag.
    </p><br>

        I decided to leave the content portion open for the templates users to do as they wish with a blank canvas. I don't like to restrict my users too much, and for this reason I leave the defining of any content related styles to you.
